Good morning. And thank you for joining us. It is so great to be back in New York and I'm really excited about what we have to share with you today. For more than 96 years Chrysler has been an iconic American automotive brand and one that's earned a reputation for bringing breakthrough innovation and creating new segments for the mainstream market that delight customers. As you know, Chrysler created the minivan segment nearly 40 years ago and has created many award-winning products throughout that time. The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid was the first and remains the only plug-in hybrid minivan. But this is just the start of our electrification journey. And that future includes our commitment to launch our first Chrysler battery electric vehicle by 2025 and to electrify the entire portfolio by 2028. In January at CES, we introduced the Chrysler Airflow which brings together all of the elements of our brand revitalization and our commitment to delivering modern, clean mobility for the mainstream market. The Airflow's designed to seamlessly connect people both physically and virtually, integrating all of the latest Stellantis technology advancements, including STLA Brain, SmartCockpit and AutoDrive. The backbone of the Airflow user experience is the new electronic software architecture known as STLA Brain. This architecture includes advanced AI technology that adapts and enhances the user experience over time. And the flexibility of the architecture enables software developers to create and quickly update features and services over-the-air without waiting for a new hardware launch. Over-the-air interfaces let passengers quickly and easily add new and innovative features which keeps the vehicle fresh, exciting, and more capable so each day of ownership just keeps getting better. Airflow SmartCockpit is built on top of STLA Brain. Using AI based applications to synchronize digital, work, and home environments and includes features like navigation, voice controls, digital personal assistant and e-commerce services. Each occupant's space and screen can be personalized to access the digital world via connected entertainment, applications, and downloads. And its seat also features a built-in camera that enables occupants to participate in a group video conference call from the comfort of the Airflow cabin. Additionally, each space can be configured as a discrete sound zone. So passengers don't hear sounds coming from other occupant spaces. The Airflow's user experience is unified and amplified with multi-layered high-contrast graphics to provide a clean, sophisticated appearance that is safe, secure, easy to use and understand. The third technology, STLA AutoDrive, delivers hands-free level 3 autonomous driving capabilities that are also over-the-air, updateable and upgradeable. Along with the fully connected user experience, the Chrysler Airflow concept previews the brand's commitment to delivering a fully electric vehicle lineup by 2028. Airflow's battery electric system includes 150 kilowatt electric drive modules in the front and the rear. The drive motors are located in the front and the rear of the vehicle to maximize interior space, deliver a larger wheel size and wider vehicle stance and the battery system is designed to achieve up to a 400-mile range on a single charge. This is the advanced technology and the platform that will drive the next generation of Chrysler forward, but it's Chrysler's new persona and experience that will draw you in and make you say, \&quot;Wow!\u201d It\u2019s ingenious, captivating design stimulates the senses allowing you to appreciate all of the details inside and out.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(classical violin music) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, as a follow up to the Airflow concept vehicle that we revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, this is the alter-ego persona. This is the all-new Chrysler Airflow Graphite concept. The Airflow Graphite's sculpted, dynamic and elegant design heightens the senses immediately. Its exterior embodies the Chrysler Brand\u2019s new contemporary technology-forward design theme. During the development of the Airflow concept vehicle, our design team developed several different personas to highlight the flexibility of the design and to create new personalities that represented our diverse customers. We were excited to collaborate with our customers to bring one of these expressions to life. The Galaxy Black exterior body color was inspired from an urban mindset that conveys a more serious, sinister, yet sophisticated attitude. This is in stark contrast to the Arctic White exterior that we first showed at CES. The Galaxy Black exterior is paired with Cypress Copper accents both inside and outgiving the overall design a sense of refined sophistication. These copper accents further accentuate Airflow Graphite's captivating design. It\u2019s symbolic of the warm glow of the Gotham City's signature skyline at night, while making a bold statement across the top of the daylight opening and selected surfaces of the wheels. The front end is highlighted by a cross car light blade featuring a new Chrysler wing logo, which is illuminated with crystal LED lighting. A crystal LED taillight also runs the full width of the vehicle accentuating the wide and capable stance. The diffuser shape of the lower fascia highlights the aerodynamic design which is key to delivering optimum driving range. The Airflow's wide stance, along with large 22-inch wheels and tires deliver excellent handling and performance dynamics. Moving inside, the Graphite's interior has the comforting appeal of a first class lounge. The environment is modern and spacious with premium features and finishes using sustainable materials and a calming color palette. The harmony between the lightness of Ice Grey and the warmth of Cypress Copper provides a sensation of Zen and modern richness of the interior. The interior has been reimagined to give a premium, tailored experience amongst the driver and passengers through integrated technology and comfort and it conveys the feeling of an oasis and provides passengers with the ability to focus on what matters most to them. Multi-infotainment screens are integrated by beautifully sculpted bonded glass that spans across the dash and is supported by soft leather-wrapped lowers that visually travel around the interior, offering a spacious, yet personal space for driver and passengers. And all of this is complimented by a jewel-like shift knob that showcases the new wing badge in a Cypress Copper finish. In addition, the new wing badge is proudly celebrated on the steering wheel and startup sequences on the displays. Slim structure seating rests on pedestal bases and delivers enhanced comfort, roominess, and personal storage for each passenger. Functional and ambient lighting can be customized to the driver and passenger's needs and has the ability to give a daytime and a nighttime look. When illuminated, the details of the vehicle are highlighted such as the leather perforation on the door, crystal trimmed shifter, and functional areas below the armrest, foot well, and storage. And the Airflow Graphite's panoramic roof allows daylight to stream into the cabin. The Airflow Graphite concept vehicle showcases advanced safety technologies, which are a true hallmark of the Chrysler brand's safety leadership. And, intuitive AI along with connected vehicle technology, because the future won't simply be about making vehicles that move from point A to point B. We\u2019re creating a seamlessly connected hub that brings the customer's lifestyle along in the vehicle. From a night on the town, to a daily commute, or even a drive upstate, the Chrysler Airflow Graphite concept is pure, captivating design that reflects the personality of its driver and the intuitive technology that's seamlessly connected and really elevates the customer experience. And that experience starts at the very beginning. When you reinvent a brand, you can't simply focus on the products. You also have to completely rethink and reinvent the customer experience. We are creating one that's developed with the customer called Project Ingenuity that will facilitate collaboration on our future innovations, services, and experiences. The result will be a uniquely personalized and delightful experience throughout the purchase, service, and ownership journey. We\u2019ve reimagined how people buy a car, streamlined the process, and designed an ownership experience around proactive and caring services. We intend to be a catalyst for change in an industry that's ready for transformation. I am so excited about the future of Chrysler. In addition to developing an all-new product portfolio, the Chrysler Brand will perform like a startup bringing an entrepreneurial spirit, speed, and renewed customer focus to the development of new products, technologies, and services throughout the customer life cycle. And that will allow us to take a leading role in delivering new mobility solutions that are cleaner safer, and more seamlessly connected. Thank you.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(audience applauds) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(classical violin music) &quot;},&quot;mediaContent&quot;:{&quot;mediaSrc&quot;:&quot;external&quot;,&quot;videoSrc&quot;:&quot;C21R1Edu46U&quot;},&quot;mediaDescriptionBar&quot;:{&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;mediaDescription&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;socialIcons&quot;:[],&quot;socialShareMessage&quot;:&quot; &quot;}}}],&quot;modalWindow&quot;:{&quot;isFullScreen&quot;:true,&quot;theming&quot;:{&quot;window&quot;:&quot;light&quot;}},&quot;tracking&quot;:{&quot;linktype&quot;:&quot;nav&quot;,&quot;lid&quot;:&quot;modal-container-close&quot;,&quot;lpos&quot;:&quot;modal-container&quot;},&quot;ctaBar&quot;:{&quot;buttons&quot;:[]}}"></div>
